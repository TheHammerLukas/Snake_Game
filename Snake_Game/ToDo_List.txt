Idea: Set a screenshot as the background of the labelGameStatus in order for the background to be pseudo transparent.


Add 'Multi Language Support'. // IDEA: Save the MLS texts and the selected language in a .xml


Add a replay functionality // Overthink this point since there is no real use compared to the complexity. Maybe write a .dll for this function so it can be used in other projects too.


Make it possible to restore the last settings


BUG: Exception handling for save files


BUG: When leaving the screen and entering it from the other side the snake doesn't get drawn correctly


Add reload gameSprite file key to 'DevMode'
