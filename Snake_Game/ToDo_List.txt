Idea: Set a screenshot as the background of the labelGameStatus in order for the background to be pseudo transparent.


TIP: there is another method using XMLs in this project (Project -> Properties -> Settings).


Add 'Multi Language Support'. // IDEA: Save the MLS texts and the selected language in a .xml


Let the player decide where the savefiles are stored on the disk


Add sounds to the game


Use textures for the snake


=> Powerup expansion:
Make the powerup food configurable
- required amount of food for powerup to spawn
- powerup duration
- powerup colors

Make the snakes color similar to the active powerup


Make food colors configurable


Add a replay functionality // Overthink this point since the is no real use compared to the complexity. Maybe write a .dll for this function so it can be used in other projects too.


Make it possible to restore the last settings


Let the user save his settings to different 'profiles'
