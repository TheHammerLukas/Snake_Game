Idea: Set a screenshot as the background of the labelGameStatus in order for the background to be pseudo transparent.


TIP: there is another method using XMLs in this project (Project -> Properties -> Settings).


Add 'Multi Language Support'. // IDEA: Save the MLS texts and the selected language in a .xml


Let the player decide where the savefiles are stored on the disk


Use textures for the snake


Add a replay functionality // Overthink this point since there is no real use compared to the complexity. Maybe write a .dll for this function so it can be used in other projects too.


Make it possible to restore the last settings


Let the user save his settings to different 'profiles'
