Idea: Set a screenshot as the background of the labelGameStatus in order for the background to be pseudo transparent.


TIP: there is another method using XMLs in this project (Project -> Properties -> Settings).


Add 'Multi Language Support'. // IDEA: Save the MLS texts and the selected language in a .xml


Let the player decide where the savefiles are stored on the disk


Spawn powerup food every 10 or so eaten foods:
-> Point multiplier
-> Point Tick ( Some amount of points get added for each game tick alive)
-> Slowmotion
-> Noclip
=> adjust the UI so the active powerup + the duration + the saved powerup is displayed.

=> Expansion:
Make the powerup food configurable
- required amount of food for powerup to spawn
- powerup duration
- key configuration
- powerup colors
-> remove from devmode to finish


Make the NoClip key configurable


Make food colors configurable


Add a replay functionality


Make it possible to restore the last settings
