Add 'Multi Language Support'. // IDEA: Save the MLS texts and the selected language in a .xml


Add a replay functionality // Overthink this point since there is no real use compared to the complexity. Maybe write a .dll for this function so it can be used in other projects too.


Make it possible to restore the last settings


Add reload gameSprite file key to 'DevMode'


Use GDI+ to display text that is currently displayed using labelGameStatus (Probably makes it possible to just draw the text above the game -> Fixes bug of label background color hiding parts of the game)
-> write new function which draws the game status text on the picturebox


Add Powerup synergy


Implement reset functionality for 'Savefiles' gameMenu tab


Implement new Labyrinth Gamemode // Brainstorm


Add colored sprites for powerups
Todo: Add functions for button press
      Add Resources for the new sprites
