Add 'Multi Language Support'. // IDEA: Save the MLS texts and the selected language in a .xml


Add a replay functionality // Overthink this point since there is no real use compared to the complexity. Maybe write a .dll for this function so it can be used in other projects too.


Make it possible to restore the last settings


Add reload gameSprite file key to 'DevMode' // Deprecated: Doesn't work.


Add textboxes to the Menu Savefiles tab which display the current save paths


Use GDI+ to display text that is currently displayed using labelGameStatus (Probably makes it possible to just draw the text above the game -> Fixes bug of label background color hiding parts of the game)


BUG: Noclip snake in corners; wrong Sprite gets drawn
